# SwissAI Alignment Codebase

## Overview

A starting point for alignment projects.

## Getting started

### Code and development environment

We support the following methods and platforms for installing the project dependencies and running the code.

- **Docker/OCI-container for AMD64 machines (+ NVIDIA GPUs)**:
  This option works for machines with AMD64 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.
  E.g. Linux machines (EPFL HaaS servers, VMs on cloud providers),
  Windows machines with WSL, and clusters running OCI-compliant containers,
  like the EPFL Run:ai (Kubernetes) clusters.

  Follow the instructions in `installation/docker-amd64-cuda/README.md` to install the environment
  then get back here for the rest of the instructions to run the experiments.

  We ran our experiments on TODO: FILL IN THE HARDWARE YOU USED.
  To run them, you should have at least TODO: FILL IN THE MINIMUM HARDWARE REQS IF APPLICABLE.

- **Docker/OCI-container for ARM64 machines (+ NVIDIA GPUs)**:
  Like the option above but for machines with ARM64 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs.
  It is in particular targeted for deployment on the CSCS Todi cluster.

  Follow the instructions in `installation/docker-amd64-cuda/README.md` to install the environment
  then get back here for the rest of the instructions to run the experiments.

  We ran our experiments on TODO: FILL IN THE HARDWARE YOU USED.
  To run them, you should have at least TODO: FILL IN THE MINIMUM HARDWARE REQS IF APPLICABLE.

- **TODO: Conda for osx-arm64**
  This option works for macOS machines with Apple Silicon and can leverage MPS acceleration.

  Follow the instructions in `installation/conda-osx-arm64-mps/README.md` to install the environment
  then get back here for the rest of the instructions to run the experiments.

  We ran our experiments on TODO: FILL IN THE HARDWARE YOU USED.
  To run them, you should have at least TODO: FILL IN THE MINIMUM HARDWARE REQS IF APPLICABLE.

### Data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO**:
> Fill `data/README.md` or delete this section, then delete this note.

Refer to `data/README.md`.

### Logging and tracking experiments

We use [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site) to log and track our experiments.
If you're logged in, your default entity will be used (a fixed entity is not set in the config),
and you can set another entity with the `WANDB_ENTITY` environment variable.
Otherwise, the runs will be anonymous (you don't need to be logged in).

## Reproduction and experimentation

### Reproducing our results

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO**:
> Keep these scripts up to date and run your experiments using them.
> Do provide the W&B runs and trained models or update this section.
> Delete this note when shipping.

We provide scripts to reproduce our work in the `reproducibility-scripts/` directory.
It has a README at its root describing which scripts reproduce which experiments.

We share our Weights and Biases runs in [this W&B project](https://wandb.ai/claire-labo/swiss-alignment).

Moreover, we make our trained models available.
You can follow the instructions in `outputs/README.md` to download and use them.

### Experiment with different configurations

The default configuration for each script is stored in the `configs/` directory.
They are managed by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/).
You can experiment with different configurations by passing the relevant arguments.
You can get examples of how to do so in the `reproducibility-scripts/` directory.

## Repository structure

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **TEMPLATE TODO**:
> Provide a quick overview of the main files in the repo for users to understand your code,
> then delete this note.

Below, we give a description of the main files and directories in this repository.

```
 └─── src/                              # Source code.
    └── swiss_alignment           # Our package.
        ├── configs/                    # Hydra configuration files.
        └── template_experiment.py      # A template experiment.
```

## Contributing

We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) hooks to ensure high-quality code.
Make sure it's installed on the system where you're developing
(it is in the dependencies of the project, but you may be editing the code from outside the development environment.
If you have conda you can install it in your base environment, otherwise, you can install it with `brew`).
Install the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
# When in the PROJECT_ROOT.
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

Then every time you commit, the pre-commit hooks will be triggered.
You can also trigger them manually with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```
